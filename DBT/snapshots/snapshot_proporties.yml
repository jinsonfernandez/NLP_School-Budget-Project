# Snapshots properties can be declared in .yml files in:

# your snapshots/ directory (as defined by the snapshot-paths config)
# your models/ directory (as defined by the model-paths config)
# We recommend that you put them in the snapshots/ directory. You can name these files whatever_you_want.yml, and nest them arbitrarily deeply in subfolders within the snapshots/ or models/ directory.
