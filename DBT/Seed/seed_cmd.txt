Seeds are CSV files in your dbt project (typically in your seeds directory), that dbt can load into your data warehouse using the dbt seed command.

Seeds can be referenced in downstream models the same way as referencing models — by using the ref function.

Because these CSV files are located in your dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which changes infrequently.

Good use-cases for seeds:

A list of mappings of country codes to country names
A list of test emails to exclude from analysis
A list of employee account IDs
Poor use-cases of dbt seeds:

Loading raw data that has been exported to CSVs
Any kind of production data containing sensitive information. For example personal identifiable information (PII) and passwords.




Example
To load a seed file in your dbt project:

Add the file to your seeds directory, with a .csv file extension, e.g. seeds/country_codes.csv
seeds/country_codes.csv
country_code,country_name
US,United States
CA,Canada
GB,United Kingdom
...

Run the dbt seed command — a new table will be created in your warehouse in your target schema, named country_codes
$ dbt seed


Refer to seeds in downstream models using the ref function.
models/orders.sql
-- This refers to the table created from seeds/country_codes.csv
select * from {{ ref('country_codes') }}

=============================================================================================================================
The columns of my seed changed, and now I get an error when running the `seed` command, what should I do?
In this case, you should rerun the command with a --full-refresh flag, like so:

dbt seed --full-refresh




How do I preserve leading zeros in a seed?
If you need to preserve leading zeros (for example in a zipcode or mobile number):

v0.16.0 onwards: Include leading zeros in your seed file, and use the column_types configuration with a varchar datatype of the correct length.
Prior to v0.16.0: Use a downstream model to pad the leading zeros using SQL, for example: lpad(zipcode, 5, '0')





How do I build one seed at a time?
$ dbt seed --select country_codes



Do hooks run with seeds?
Yes! The following hooks are available:

pre-hooks & post-hooks
on-run-start & on-run-end hooks
